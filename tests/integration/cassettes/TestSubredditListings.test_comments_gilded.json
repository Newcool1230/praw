There is lots of thing to see too but everything is not as high quality as in Norway. Finland is cheaper than Norway but more expensive than Sweden. Here are not many things to see and this is not that nice of a place as Norway or Sweden. In Norway and Sweden people are more sociable and less awkward than in Finland so if you want to talk to the locals I'd suggest you don't come to Finland. If you want best quality for best price go to Sweden. Scenery, brewery and quality wise best is Norway.

Norway is the most expensive country out of these three countries but it is the most beautiful too. There is a lot stuff to see in Norway so if you aren\\u0026#39;t tight on penny you should check Troms\\u00f8 out. Sweden is the cheapest country of these three but it is still a great place to visit. There is lots of thing to see too but everything is not as high quality as in Norway. Finland is cheaper than Norway but more expensive than Sweden. Here are not many things to see and this is not that nice of a place as Norway or Sweden. In Norway and Sweden people are more sociable and less awkward than in Finland so if you want to talk to the locals I\\u0026#39;d suggest you don\\u0026#39;t come to Finland. If you want best quality for best price go to Sweden. Scenery, brewery and quality wise best is Norway.

This is why my comprehension is always delayed when someone talks to me.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWith my speech, I have to make sure I\\u0026#39;m shaping my lips the right way, I\\u0026#39;m putting my tongue in the right place, I\\u0026#39;m blowing out enough air to create the pronunciation without being too loud or too quiet, and I have to coordinate my actual speech to the letters I\\u0026#39;m pronouncing with my mouth, because you can essentially whisper without using your vocal cords. I have never actually whispered on purpose, I don\\u0026#39;t really know if it\\u0026#39;s just air going out or if people quietly voice while they do it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAll of this \\u0026quot;mechanical\\u0026quot; stuff goes into a conversation before you even get a chance to think about the subject.  This is why children who have significant hearing loss should be encouraged to learn ASL.  Using it is such a relief from all the mental work of trying to understand and speak English, plus it helps a lot when you get into higher education.  When I used a hearing aid I could not wait until I went home to take the damn thing off and just take a break from all the stress.  I think you could compare it a bit to moving to a country that uses a different language, and you\\u0026#39;re always stuck in the level of having to work at understanding that language.  You never get to where you can listen and respond without working at it.  That\\u0026#39;s how I go through life.  ASL is an amazing respite and I prefer to use it but so few hearing people know it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\", \"quarantine\": false, \"subreddit\": \"AskReddit\", \"score_hidden\": false, \"name\": \"t1_d62wsuk\", \"created\": 1470282267.0, \"author_flair_text\": null, \"link_url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4vydue/serious_deaf_redditors_how_does_your_inner/\", \"created_utc\": 1470253467.0, \"ups\": 306, \"mod_reports\": [], \"num_reports\": null, \"distinguished\": null}}, {\"kind\": \"t1\", \"data\": {\"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh1i\", \"link_title\": \"[Serious] Deaf redditors, how does your inner monologue sound?

I just realized why I hate it when adults depend on me, and act like they need me.  I almost left my wife over it after she lost our first pregnancy.  \\n\\nI spent my entire child hood looking after my mother and my older sister.  It started out with small stuff when I was 5 or 6.  I'd keep wearing the same shoes and wouldn't tell mom I needed new ones because I knew she couldn't afford new ones, even though I was wearing holes in my socks because the bottoms of my shoes were gone.\\n\\nThen as I got a little older it started with bigger stuff.  Defending my two year older sister against our step father that wanted to have his way with her.  Nursing my mother through severe depression and three suicide attempts.  Cleaning up the drugs and beer bottles after their parties.  Helping to hide their stash when the cops raided...\\n\\nFinally at 10 I started trying to be 100% independent while still living within my parents house.  I knew I couldn't get a place of my own, I was too young, so I did the best I could.  By 11 I had a job, was buying all of my own clothes and school supplies, and doing as much of the chores as I could.  By 13 I took care of the lawn, laundry, dishes, bathroom, and seasonally, I chopped the wood for the winter.  By 14 I could chop a cord of wood in an hour, if it was good and dry.\\n\\nThat was my life through the rest of my school career.  My sister left a couple of years before I graduated high school.  She moved in with her new boy friend, but it was mainly to get away from our toxic home.  I can't blame her for leaving, but I always felt abandoned and that she was ungrateful for what I did to protect her from further abuse.  \\n\\nMy father had been out of my life for years.  He would shower my sister with love and affection but wouldn't come near me.  I only learned in my mid thirties why though.  He is a pedophile.  After his father raped him repeatedly throughout my father's childhood, he swore never to do that to me.  But he was afraid of himself and what he would do to me, so he just cut off all contact as much as he could.  I still remember seeing the tears welling in his eyes when he would infrequently plead, \\\"You know I love you, don't you?\\\" as he was playing with my sister and I sat alone in a room full of my family.\\n\\nThen, the last day of high school.  I made it.  I graduated with decent marks.  I might be able to make something of my life.  I held it together for over a decade, I even managed to forge a few friendships along the way.  Not many, I had no idea how to socialize, but some.  I came home from school with my report card, it was 10ish in the morning, and there was a U-Haul backed up to the front door.  My step father was away for a few days.  Finally, I thought, we're getting away from that asshole.  I called a close friend that lived just up the street, and him, my mother and I loaded everything from the kitchen and her room into the u-haul.

I just realized why I hate it when adults depend on me, and act like they need me.  I almost left my wife over it after she lost our first pregnancy.  \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI spent my entire child hood looking after my mother and my older sister.  It started out with small stuff when I was 5 or 6.  I\\u0026#39;d keep wearing the same shoes and wouldn\\u0026#39;t tell mom I needed new ones because I knew she couldn\\u0026#39;t afford new ones, even though I was wearing holes in my socks because the bottoms of my shoes were gone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThen as I got a little older it started with bigger stuff.  Defending my two year older sister against our step father that wanted to have his way with her.  Nursing my mother through severe depression and three suicide attempts.  Cleaning up the drugs and beer bottles after their parties.  Helping to hide their stash when the cops raided...\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFinally at 10 I started trying to be 100% independent while still living within my parents house.  I knew I couldn\\u0026#39;t get a place of my own, I was too young, so I did the best I could.  By 11 I had a job, was buying all of my own clothes and school supplies, and doing as much of the chores as I could.  By 13 I took care of the lawn, laundry, dishes, bathroom, and seasonally, I chopped the wood for the winter.  By 14 I could chop a cord of wood in an hour, if it was good and dry.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat was my life through the rest of my school career.  My sister left a couple of years before I graduated high school.  She moved in with her new boy friend, but it was mainly to get away from our toxic home.  I can\\u0026#39;t blame her for leaving, but I always felt abandoned and that she was ungrateful for what I did to protect her from further abuse.  \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy father had been out of my life for years.  He would shower my sister with love and affection but wouldn\\u0026#39;t come near me.  I only learned in my mid thirties why though.  He is a pedophile.  After his father raped him repeatedly throughout my father\\u0026#39;s childhood, he swore never to do that to me.  But he was afraid of himself and what he would do to me, so he just cut off all contact as much as he could.  I still remember seeing the tears welling in his eyes when he would infrequently plead, \\u0026quot;You know I love you, don\\u0026#39;t you?\\u0026quot; as he was playing with my sister and I sat alone in a room full of my family.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThen, the last day of high school.  I made it.  I graduated with decent marks.  I might be able to make something of my life.  I held it together for over a decade, I even managed to forge a few friendships along the way.
